## Project Structure

The structure of the repository is as follows:

- README.md
- client
- server

### Client

The client folder contains front-end code written in React. 

### Server

The server folder contains back-end code written in Node.js


### Starting the Development Server

To start the client side code, server side and database together (this is the most convienient way), you can do so with the following commands:
1. `npm install && npm install --prefix client`
2. `npm run develop`

Please note that you run `npm install && npm install --prefix client` during your first installation, subsequently you will only need to run `npm run develop`.
